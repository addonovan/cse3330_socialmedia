# Social Media Site

## About 

This is a semester-long project for the CSE 3330, Database and File Systems, class at
UTA. The goal of this project is to create a simple social media site from a set of
requirements, letting us learn how to setup and interact with databases.

This project uses PostgreSQL as the RDBMS and Spring MVC via springboot as the webserver.

As usual, this is not meant to be used for anything serious.

## Setup 

1. Install PostgreSQL 10.5 on your machine.
    * See [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Import the Gradle project with IntelliJ
